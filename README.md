## ‚ö°Ô∏è Motivation

In collaborative data science projects, teams often struggle with scattered tools, inconsistent dataset versions, and inefficient communication. While there are existing platforms, many are either too costly, overly complex, or lack the flexibility needed for educational or small-team environments. This motivated us to build a streamlined, web-based platform that allows data scientists to upload datasets, create visualizations, and collaborate in real-time within a centralized workspace.

This project not only addresses a practical need in data analysis workflows but also allows us to gain hands-on experience with modern full-stack development tools, such as Next.js, PostgreSQL, and cloud storage, in a realistic and technically challenging context.

## üéØ Objectives

Our goal is to develop a full-stack web application that empowers teams to collaborate on data analysis efficiently. The main objectives include:

- Implement user authentication and team-based workspace management to support secure and organized collaboration.

- Enable dataset upload and preview with support for CSV, Excel, and JSON formats.

- Provide data visualization tools using libraries like Chart.js, along with interactive table views.

- Support sharing permissions, commenting on visualizations, and metadata management to enhance collaboration and clarity.

- Ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, backed by a robust PostgreSQL database and cloud file storage.

By fulfilling these objectives, we aim to build a platform that not only meets the course‚Äôs technical requirements but also delivers real-world value to users.
