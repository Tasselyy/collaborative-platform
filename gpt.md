1. **Collaborative Data Analysis Platform**

   A web-based platform where data scientists can upload datasets, create visualizations, and collaborate on analysis projects in real-time.

   **Key features:**

   - User authentication and team workspace management
   - Dataset upload and management (CSV, JSON, Excel)
   - Data visualization using existing libraries (e.g. [Chart.js ](https://www.chartjs.org/))
   - Data table view with sorting and filtering
   - Dataset metadata management
   - Sharing permissions (public/private, team access)
   - Comments and annotations on visualizations
   - Export visualizations as images
   - PostgreSQL for metadata and user data
   - Cloud storage for dataset files

# Database Design

This design includes **Teams** for shared access, **Users** for authentication and ownership, **Datasets** for uploaded data, **Visualizations** for creating charts, and **Comments** for collaboration.

------

## 1. Models Overview

1. **Team**
   - Groups users for shared or team-based dataset access.
   - Each team can have multiple members.
   - Each team can own multiple datasets (via the dataset’s `teamId` field).
2. **User**
   - Represents a single registered user who can log in.
   - Stores user profile info: name, email, image.
   - A user can belong to multiple teams (many-to-many relationship).
   - A user can own many datasets.
   - A user can author many comments.
3. **Dataset**
   - Represents a data file uploaded by a user or team (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.).
   - Stores metadata (name, description), plus a `fileUrl` referencing the file location in cloud storage.
   - Each dataset is owned by exactly one user (the `owner`), but can also be accessible to an entire team via the `teamId`.
   - Has a `visibility` field (enum) to define public/private/team access.
4. **Visualization**
   - Defines charts, graphs, or other visual representations of a dataset.
   - Each visualization references a single dataset (via `datasetId`).
   - Stores chart type (bar, line, etc.) and configuration (in JSON) for flexible customization.
   - Can have many comments from different users.
5. **Comment**
   - Allows users to annotate or discuss a specific visualization.
   - Each comment references exactly one user (the author) and one visualization.

# Implementation

## ✅ Step-by-Step Plan to Start the Project

### 1. **Project Initialization**

- Make sure you have **Node.js** and **pnpm/npm/yarn** installed.
- Create the Next.js app with App Router support:

```
bash


复制编辑
npx create-next-app@latest collaborative-platform --app --typescript
```

- Choose:
  - App Router: ✅ Yes
  - Tailwind CSS: ✅ Yes
  - ESLint: ✅ Yes
  - src directory: ✅ Yes

------

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

- UI components: `shadcn/ui`
- DB & ORM: `prisma`, `@prisma/client`
- Auth: `next-auth`
- File upload: `@uploadthing/react`, `uploadthing`
- Charts: `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`
- WebSocket: `socket.io` (if using real-time collab)

------

### 3. **Set Up Project Structure**

```
ruby复制编辑collaborative-platform/

```

------

### 4. **Initial Setup Checklist**

-  Configure Tailwind with `shadcn/ui`
-  Setup `prisma` schema: users, datasets, visualizations
-  Connect to PostgreSQL
-  Implement auth with `next-auth` (GitHub, Google, etc.)
-  Set up cloud file upload (e.g., UploadThing, S3, or Supabase)
-  Build base layout (responsive sidebar/header)

------

### 5. **Must-Have Pages/Features**

- `/login` — Sign in/up
- `/dashboard` — View datasets & visualizations
- `/upload` — Upload dataset files
- `/dataset/[id]` — View + visualize dataset
- `/team` — Team management (optional for workspace features)

------

### 6. **Advanced Features You’ll Build**

- ✅ **Authentication** – With `next-auth`
- ✅ **File handling** – Cloud file upload + processing
- Optionally:
  - Real-time team comments (with socket.io or Pusher)
  - External API integration (e.g., OpenAI for smart insights)

## Step 3

### 1. Your Updated Project Structure

```

├── app/                    # App Router pages
│   ├── api/                # API Routes (e.g., auth, upload)

```

## Step 4

Create a `prisma/schema.prisma` file with these models:

- `User` → Authentication
- `Dataset` → Uploaded data files
- `Visualization` → Charts tied to datasets
- `Comment` → Team collaboration notes

------

### ✅ Step-by-step:

#### 1. Open `prisma/schema.prisma`

Replace it with:

```
prisma复制编辑generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String?   @unique
  image         String?
  datasets      Dataset[]
  comments      Comment[]
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
}

model Dataset {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  description   String?
  fileUrl       String     // Cloud storage link
  ownerId       String
  owner         User       @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
  visualizations Visualization[]
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
}

model Visualization {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  title         String
  type          String      // e.g., "bar", "line"
  config        Json        // Chart.js config
  datasetId     String
  dataset       Dataset     @relation(fields: [datasetId], references: [id])
  comments      Comment[]
  createdAt     DateTime    @default(now())
}

model Comment {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  content       String
  authorId      String
  vizId         String
  author        User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  visualization Visualization @relation(fields: [vizId], references: [id])
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
}
```

------

### ✅ 2. Update `.env`

Make sure your `.env` file has:

```
env


复制编辑
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_db_name"
```

Replace with your actual PostgreSQL connection.

------

### ✅ 3. Push to the database

```
bash


复制编辑
npx prisma db push
```

This creates the tables in your database based on your schema.

------

### ✅ 4. Generate the client

```
bash


复制编辑
npx prisma generate
```
